Flag Trivia iOS Application

This is a trivia game where you have to guess the country the flag belongs to. The game keeps track of the high score with NSUserDefaults. You have 15 seconds to guess the flag or it counts it as wrong and gives you a new flag. The game goes up to 24 and your score is how many you got right.
